      <p class="text-gray-700">
        Sheva Nari O Shishu Kallyan Kendra, meaning "service" in Bangla, is an
        NGO founded in
        <span class="font-bold">1991</span> to advance women's development.
        Created by women, Sheva's mission is to empower Bangladeshi women
        through grassroots mobilization, research, and advocacy.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2">Sheva's Model</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        Sheva engages with microcredit borrowers in various capacities,

      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-4 mt-2">

      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2">
        Registrations and Certifications
      </h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-4 mt-2">
        <li>
          Registered with Ministry of Women and Children's Affairs (MOWCA) in
          1993

      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2">Microcredit Services</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        Sheva began offering microcredit to women in the slums around Dhaka
        City. In 1995, they received a grant from the Netherlands Embassy, which
        expanded their capital and allowed them to service more urban women.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        Sheva steadily built a network among urban poor women and brought
        training and education to them.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2">Sheva's Work Expansion</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        Since then, Sheva's work has expanded to include:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-4 mt-2">
        <li>Education among poor women</li>
        <li>Training for factory workers and management</li>
        <li>Women's rights research and advocacy</li>

      </ul>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mt-8">
        Sheva is no longer affiliated with their original catering operation,
        which is now independently servicing businesses throughout Dhaka City.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2">Women's Rights in Bangladesh</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        In Bangladesh, women face particularly high levels of discrimination.
        Gender discrimination, defective and discriminatory laws, as well as
        ingrained religious and cultural notions all contribute to an
        environment where women are denied many basic rights.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2">
        Sheva's Efforts for Women's Rights
      </h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        Through the implementation of programs designed with these factors in
        mind, Sheva has supported women in creating avenues for them to enter
        the world of work independently. Lessons learned from working with women
        at the grassroots level have formed the basis of our program structure
        and keep adding meaningful dimensions to ongoing programs.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-4 mt-2 space-y-2">
        <li>
          To aid in the poverty alleviation movement by providing women with
          micro-credit loans
        </li>
        <li>
          To guarantee the effectiveness of the micro-credit loans through
          supporting programs like adult education, training and business
          counseling.
        </li>
        <li>
          To undertake studies and develop programs to protect, promote and
          legitimize women’s rights at the work place thus in the broader
          society in Bangladesh.
        </li>
        <li>To promote socially responsible business practices</li>
        <li>
          To raise awareness among grassroots workers on their health needs
        </li>
        <li>
          Empower grassroots workers to lead a self-reliant, confident and
          honorable life.
        </li>
        <li>secure and protect women’s rights in all walks of life.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2">Goals</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        Sheva’s principle, activities and efforts are directed towards one goal
        that is, achieving egalitarianism in the society in terms of gender
        distribution of labor (GDOL). With preferential advantage in certain
        sectors of employment and business ownership, Bangladeshi women can
        bridge the gap in the existing male hegemonic system of economy. Women
        are valuable part of the community, utilization of their labor and
        skills are imperative to a society’s sustainable development. With equal
        opportunities and access to the world of work, women can bring in
        revenues to themselves and their families. This can contribute
        positively to the community they live in, thus strengthening the economy
        of the society.
