        Day care service has been one of Sheva’s core programs since its
        inception in 1991. In 2006 Sheva started a day care center for the
        employees of Bangladesh Bank, the Central Bank of Bangladesh. The
        service provided are nutritious, meals age appropriate play time, care
        such as bathing and arranging napping time helping with school work etc.
        Sheva’s successful advocacy for child care for working women with
        Bangladesh Bank facilitated the enactment of a Govt. circular for all
        banks to open day care centers in their head office and main branches.
        Currently we are running four day care centers for reputable banks and
        educational institutions giving care and service to children
